### Description

Like Missy Elliot, we like to "put our [Feather] down, flip it and reverse it" and that's exactly what we've done with this new development board. It's basically our ESP32-S2 TFT Feather but with the 240x135 color TFT display on the back-side not the front-side. That makes it great for panel-mounted projects, particularly since we've also got some space for 3 buttons to go along. It's like an all-in-one display interface dev board, powered by the fantastic ESP32-S2 WIFI module.

This feather comes with native USB and 4 MB flash + 2 MB of PSRAM, so it is perfect for use with CircuitPython or Arduino with low-cost WiFi. Native USB means it can act like a keyboard or a disk drive. WiFi means it's awesome for IoT projects. And Feather means it works with the large community of Feather Wings for expandability.

The ESP32-S2 is a highly-integrated, low-power, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi System-on-Chip (SoC) solution that now has built-in native USB as well as some other interesting new technologies like Time of Flight distance measurements. With its state-of-the-art power and RF performance, this SoC is an ideal choice for a wide variety of application scenarios relating to the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable electronics, and smart homes.
